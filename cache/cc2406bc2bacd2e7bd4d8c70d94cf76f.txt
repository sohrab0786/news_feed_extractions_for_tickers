# United Airlines Reaches Tentative Agreement with Flight Attendants

## Industry-Leading Wages and Improvements in Scheduling and Quality of Life

United Airlines (UAL) and the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA have announced a tentative agreement that includes industry-leading wages, a signing bonus, and significant improvements in scheduling and quality of life. The agreement will benefit 28,000 flight attendants and amend their contract for the next five years.

The approval process now moves to the Association's Master Executive Council, where all Local Presidents will review the final contract language. If they give the green light, flight attendants will vote on the agreement. This development reflects growing efforts to prioritize the needs of frontline employees in a highly competitive and service-driven industry.

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby emphasized the essential role flight attendants play in the airline's success, calling them "the face of our operation." His comments highlight a broader industry trend where airlines increasingly acknowledge the impact of frontline staff on safety and service quality. If flight attendants ratify this deal, the agreement could set a new standard across the airline industry, showing how collaborative negotiations can lead to meaningful improvements for employees and long-term benefits for the company.
