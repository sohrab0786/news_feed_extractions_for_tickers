# Amazon Launches Serverless Distributed SQL Database

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has announced the general availability of **Amazon Aurora DSQL**, a serverless distributed SQL database designed to address performance limitations in globally distributed applications. This strategic launch marks AWS' comprehensive response to growing enterprise demands for advanced databases that balance low latency and strong consistency without operational compromise.

## Global Infrastructure Leadership

The release of Aurora DSQL across eight AWS regions, with plans for further expansion, demonstrates the company's commitment to global infrastructure leadership. A flexible pay-per-use pricing model, including **AWS Free Tier**, lowers adoption barriers for new customers while increasing revenue streams from existing enterprise accounts through expanded usage.

**Technical Innovation**

Aurora DSQL resolves a fundamental challenge in distributed computing by providing simultaneous low latency and strong consistency capabilities. Traditional distributed databases forced customers to choose between these critical features, creating significant operational trade-offs. The innovative service promises read and write speeds up to **four times faster** than competing distributed SQL databases while maintaining impressive **99.999% multi-Region availability standards**.

The serverless architecture eliminates complex infrastructure management tasks, including provisioning, patching, and instance management responsibilities. This operational simplification appeals to enterprises seeking reduced database administration costs while scaling operations globally and efficiently.
